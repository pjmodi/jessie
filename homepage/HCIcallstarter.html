            <p>The <i>Bachelor of Science in User Experience Design (UXD)</i> prepares students for the expanding fields
                of user experience and interaction design. The program integrates visual design, code, and user
                research. Concepts and skills involved include design principles, prototyping, and usability testing.
                Students will learn how to analyze, design, develop, and evaluate effective computer interfaces to
                provide better user experiences.

            <>Masters of Science Human-Computer Interaction</>
            <p>The <i>Master of Science in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)</i> prepares students to ideate, design,
                implement and evaluate information and communication technologies (ICTs) so they are useful and usable
                for end users. This interdisciplinary degree integrates concepts and methods from computer science,
                graphic design and the social sciences. Drawing upon these concepts and methods, students learn
                user-centered and participatory design approaches as they create ICTs, including dynamic websites,
                mobile apps and desktop applications. Particular emphasis is given to ICT evaluation, exploratory user
                research, information architecture, interaction design and prototype development. </p>

            <>Masters of ArtsExperience Design></>
            <p>The <i>Master of Arts in Experience Design</i> prepares students in the practice of designing products,
                processes, services, events and environments with a focus placed on the quality of the user experience
                and culturally relevant solutions. It is ideal for students seeking to learn the design methods that
                will enable them to address a range of problems across disciplines through the design of solutions that
                integrate mobile technologies, interactive systems, media, social practices and face-to-face
                interactions. Graduates will be prepared to produce diverse work that spans software development, user
                research, products, systems, services and games. </p>
